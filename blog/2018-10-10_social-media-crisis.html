                <h2 align="center">Letters to the Editor and Literary Production</h2>

                <div class="note" align="center">
                    <p>This is a version of the talk I gave at the 2018 <a
                            href="https://bigmagazines.sciencesconf.org/">Mediating American
                            Modernist Literature: The Case of/for Big Magazines,
                        1880—1960</a>,<br />Aix-Marseille Université, Aix-en-Provence, France.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The Harlem Renaissance, in some ways, has always been a part of modernism. Susan
                    S. Friedman reminds us, <q>Picasso's primitivism, Fitzgerald's Jazz Age, Eliot's
                        apelike Sweeney, Sherwood Anderson's ‘dark laughter,’ Faulkner's racially
                        divided South--all [these] exist on the terrain of canonical modernist
                        studies. But not the primary producers of jazz, not the black artists
                        turning to an imaginary (or real) Africa, not the blues singers and the
                        folk, leaving the rural South for the urban North in the Great Migration,
                        not the soldiers returning from a brutal war to demand more freedoms</q>
                    (508).</p>
                <p>More recent conversations, started by Adam McKible and Suzanne Churchill, have
                    brought these two literary movements within the same critical frame. But these
                    efforts prove difficult as definitions of modernism and the Harlem Renaissance,
                    for that matter prove elusive and indeterminate.</p>
                <p> If <q>modernism began in the magazines,</q> as Robert Scholes and Clifford
                    Wulfman argue, then it’s important to understand the various participants within
                    any given magazine. It might be in the magazines where we can finally see what
                    connects. I’d like to look at a few key moments in <i>The Crisis</i>, a major
                    magazine of the Harlem Renaissance, and explore how letters to the editors
                    functioned as a key mode of modernist production. More specifically, I’d like to
                    argue for two things: <ol>
                        <li>Magazine readers were active participants in the creation of cultural
                            works and literature</li>
                        <li>And, this active role of readers provides a link for understanding the
                            Harlem Renaissance as <q>modernist.</q></li>
                    </ol> After looking at <i>The Crisis</i> as a case study, I’d like to zoom
                    outward with a digital analysis and tentatively claim that readers had
                    significant role in the production of magazine production, namely editorial
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>There were many magazines that contributed to the Harlem Renaissance. There was
                    the <i>Messenger</i>, <i>Opportunity</i>, <i>Fire!!</i>, and we might even add
                        <i>The Masses</i>, plus many others that came before the turn of the
                    century. The largest, however, was <i>The Crisis</i>. <i>The Crisis</i> was
                    founded in 1910 as the official newsletter and literary magazine of the National
                    Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Its primary goal, as
                    stated in its inaugural issue, was to <q>set forth the facts and arguments which
                        show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested to-day toward
                        colored people</q> (TC 1.1, 10).</p>

                <p>Many famous writers acquired critical acclaim while contributing to the magazine,
                    including Jessie Fauset, the magazine’s literary editor, James Weldon Johnson,
                    Countee Cullen, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Zora Neale Hurston. While the famous
                    authors who appeared in The Crisis are well known, less familiar are its
                    readers.</p>
                <p>To explore how the magazine called upon its readers, I’d like to start with just
                    the fourth issue of The Crisis. Where W.E.B. Du Bois posted this short blurb in
                    the front matter: <blockquote>Do not hesitate to criticize us. We want ideas. We
                        want short, live articles, with facts done into English. We are not anxious
                        for opinion and we write poetry ourselves. If you do not get your copy,
                        write us. If you do, and like it, write us. If you do not like it, do not
                        fail to write us. Have you got any interesting pictures ‘along the Color
                        Line?’ Send them to us. In fact, help us to help you and yours.</blockquote>
                    From its earliest years, <i>The Crisis</i> expressed the importance of its
                    readers and, perhaps more than most magazines at the time, relied on its
                    readership to accomplish its political and cultural goals.</p>
                <p>Two moments in particular highlight the importance of the magazine reader. The
                    first is a published correspondence between Henry E. Baker and Lloyd Osbourne.
                    Baker, the third African American to enter the US Naval Academy, wrote to Lloyd
                    Osbourne critiquing one of Osbourne’s protagonist in <i>The Kingdoms of the
                        World</i>. At the time of their exchange, Osbourne’s novel was being
                    serialized in <i>Munsey’s Magazine</i>. Daggancourt, a fictional Black cadet
                    enlisted at Westpoint in the novel, suffers constant racism with seemingly
                    endless patience. Baker criticizes this portrayal of Daggancourt writing,
                        <q>Daggancourt as a mere character in the literary world…may be
                        plausible,</q> but <q>as a type of ‘better educated colored man,’…[it] is
                        not only a positive impossibility, but a harmful suggestion</q> (26). The
                        <q>restraints placed around the educated colored man of older days,</q>
                    which <q>tend[ed] to stifle his manhood and minimize his self-respect…certainly
                        is not typically true of him to-day,</q> and he would no longer <q>demean
                        himself as to accept voluntarily the humiliating conditions upon which
                        Daggancourt was allowed to remain.</q></p>
                <p>Baker’s charge against Osbourne’s portrayal anticipates by nearly a decade the
                    values of race pride central to the New Negro Movement and Harlem Renaissance.
                    Additionally, Baker’s objection lays out the social stakes of Black
                    representation in print culture. He writes, <q>by no means the least of the
                        obstacles to the progress of self-respecting colored men [is] that authors
                        of note… persist consciously or unconsciously in holding these men up to
                        public contempt and ridicule</q> (26). Baker’s effort to intervene in
                    Osbourne’s story, especially as it was still being written, suggests an
                    understanding of the power of social capital in swaying public thought. His
                    letter also reinforces the framework of mutual cooperation between reader and
                    producer.</p>
                <p>Osbourne’s response is defensive and attempts to reassure Baker of his good
                    intentions, but it seems ultimately dismissive. I’m not sure if Osbourne
                    adjusted his novel after this correspondence. I’d love to find this manuscript
                    in an archive and see if there were any key revisions. Nevertheless, this
                    correspondence illustrates the access some readers had to authors. Furthermore,
                    it appears in the issue immediately after the magazine’s call for reader
                    engagement. Baker and Osbourne’s letters also help to contextualize the second
                    moment I’d like to draw attention to.</p>

                <p>This moment of a reader writing directly to an author is perhaps a rarity. It is
                    also, however, emblematic of the possibilities that serialized print culture
                    afforded to readers and authors. Both groups with the editors acitng as
                    moderators could communicate with each other and share their thoughts,
                    preferences, and prejudices. Another moment illustrates a different kind of
                    experience.</p>

                <p>In the January 1917 issue, Nicholas Vachel Lindsay wrote to J. E. Spingarn,
                    Chairman of the NAACP, asking why his poems had <q>been denounced by the colored
                        people for reasons [he could not] fathom</q> (113—114). <div class="row">
                        <div class="column">
                            <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                                src="../images/2018-10-10_social-media-crisis/Crisis_LindsayLetter.jpg"

                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                                src="../images/2018-10-10_social-media-crisis/Crisis_SpingarnResponse.jpg"
                                alt="Lindsay's Letter to Spingarn" />
                        </div>
                    </div> Lindsay was specifically referring to his poems <q>Congo</q> and the
                        <q>Booker T. Washington Trilogy.</q> The editorial stance of these poems had
                    originally applauded Lindsay’s work, but later condemned them. Lindsay and
                    Spingarn assign responsibility for the magazine’s editorial pivot to the
                    readers. Lindsay assumes those who have condemned his writing <q>have not taken
                        the trouble to read</q> his works, and yet their opinion is able to sway
                    cultural capital and undo his status within The Crisis. Spingarn similarly
                    explains The Crisis’s review of Lindsay’s poetry through the influence of
                    readers: <blockquote>No colored man doubts your good intentions, but many of
                        them doubt your understanding of their hopes... How can we fail to be
                        grateful for all this beauty? But somehow we feel (and I say ‘we’ because in
                        this I share the feelings of the colored race), somehow we feel that you do
                        not write about colored humanity as you write about white
                        humanity.</blockquote> Spingarn’s response moves from reporting the tastes
                    of <q>the colored race,</q> at least those readers and non-readers who have
                    supposedly dismissed Lindsay’s poetry, to sharing and adopting their concerns as
                    his own.</p>

                <p>This moment is significant because it credits the readers with determining
                    literary taste. More than that, though, Spingarn’s letter marks a significant
                    change of heart by the editors. Lindsay had been praised in earlier issues of
                    the magazine, but opinions of him eventually soured. Perhaps, readers like Baker
                    provided feedback that led to this re-evaluation of the poet. Tracking Lindsay’s
                    rise and fall in <i>The Crisis</i>, then, demystifies the ways of the cultural
                    market, the acquisition and loss of cultural capital within the magazine, and
                    highlights how the magazine often functioned as broker between readers and
                    authors.</p>
                <p>At the time of writing his letter to Spingarn, Lindsay’s acclaim had been
                    growing. He was a popular, traveling poet and was part of the Midwestern <q>New
                        Poetry</q> group. At the inaugural banquet of Poetry, another large American
                    literary magazine, he had impressed W. B. Yeats with his recitation of
                        <q>Congo.</q> His fame, however, was short lived and by the 1920s he drew
                    little attention. After his death in 1931, Harriet Monroe, the editor of
                        <i>Poetry</i>, recalled Lindsay as <q>a modern knight-errant,</q> a <q>Don
                        Quixote of our so-called unbelieving, unromantic age</q> (<q>Comment,</q>
                    93). Edgar Lee Masters, another minor poet at the time, similarly saw Lindsay as
                    a rising star. Lindsay’s critical reputation quickly declined into obscurity as
                    well with only brief reprisals.</p>
                <p>Before his letter to Spingarn, however, Lindsay found some success in <i>The
                        Crisis</i>. His story, <q>The Golden-Faced People: A Story of the Chinese
                        Conquest of America,</q> was a featured piece in the November 1914 issue. In
                    the following issue, <q>Congo</q> was given a promotional blurb. Du Bois had
                    even given Lindsay’s poem tentative praise in the <q>Opinion</q> section of the
                    May 1915 issue. Du Bois wrote, <q>Colored readers may be repelled at first at
                        Lindsay’s great poem but it is, in its spirit, a splendid tribute with all
                        its imperfections of spiritual insight</q> (<q>A Poem on the Negro,</q> 18).
                    Du Bois’s brief commendation functions as an introduction to another letter from
                    Lindsay, in which he explains his poetical process. Du Bois’s words have the
                    effect of validating Lindsay’s work despite its flaws and use of
                    primitivism.</p>
                <p>The piece immediately following Du Bois’s introduction of Lindsay reinforces the
                    magazine’s validation of his poetry even further, by juxtaposing it with a
                    rejection of another work. Du Bois’s praise of Lindsay is followed by a
                    collection of negative reviews of the racist movie, <i>The Birth of a
                    Nation</i>. These reviews specifically condemn D. W. Griffith’s representation
                    of Blackness, saying: <q>The producer seems to have followed the principle of
                        gathering the most vicious and grotesque individuals he could find among the
                        colored people, and showing them as representatives of the truths of the
                        entire race</q> (19). These negative reviews are not surprising. They do,
                    however, underscore Du Bois’s earlier praise of Lindsay’s works. The
                    juxtaposition of the two sets of reviews lends even more affirmation to
                    Lindsay’s poetry despite its use of primitivism. Du Bois’s praise of Lindsay’s
                    poem has the effect of affixing even more validation because of its contrast to
                    the negative reviews of <i>Birth of a Nation</i>.</p>
                <p><i>The Crisis</i>, however, reversed their initial appraisal of Lindsay’s poems a
                    year later. In the August 1916 issue, the literary review section of the
                    magazine, <q>The Looking Glass,</q> heavily criticizes Lindsay’s two poems in
                    terms similar to its condemnation of Birth. It states, <q>Mr. Vachel Lindsay
                        knows two things, and two things only, about Negroes: The beautiful rhythm
                        of their music and the ugly side of their drunkards and outcasts</q> (182).
                    Similar to Du Bois’s earlier piece, this review also admits that Lindsay’s
                    poetry displays <q>defects as well as his genius.</q> It, too, includes excerpts
                    from the poems and Lindsay’s own explanation of his process. But the review ends
                    with a damning reflection that Lindsay’s work is <q>well meant, but some of it
                        nonsense</q> and that he <q>knows little of the Negro, and that little is
                        dangerous.</q> What is striking about this critique is how it echoes Du
                    Bois’s condemnation of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> and Du Bois’s literary
                    resistance to primitivism.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The magazine’s reversal highlights the tentative state of taste in magazines.
                    Magazines can quickly withdraw their cultural investment when an author, even
                    one on the rise, fails the schemes of their literary evaluations. Although the
                    tangle of influences and pressures that led to Lindsay’s literary downfall is
                    obscure, Lindsay and Spingarn place responsibility on the readers. Whether real
                    or imagined, there was an accepted belief between the two that the readers
                    guided the magazine’s content.</p>
                <p>So, again, if <q>modernism began in the magazines,</q> then what was chosen to go
                    into the magazines—and how those pieces were chosen—would be an integral
                    component of modernism? The letters of Baker, Osbourne, Spingarn, and Lindsay
                    are just a few examples that start to show the shape of reader engagement. There
                    are many more letters from readers in nearly every issue of the magazine. As a
                    big magazine, <i>The Crisis</i> was attentive to their readers interests and
                    chose literary pieces that reflected those interests.</p>

                <p>Determining the extent of readerly influence—or any kind of causality—in literary
                    studies is tricky. The letters I’ve shown suggest that readers were important
                    players in the field of cultural arts. But, there is more work to be done with
                        <i>The Crisis</i> and other magazines.</p>
                <p>To conclude, I want to briefly and tentatively supplement the anecdotal evidence
                    of these letters with a computational analysis. Using a method called topic
                    modeling, I am able to reduce each article, letter, poem, and other genres to a
                    set of topics. I’d be happy to discuss the technical details afterward, but for
                    now it helps to know that topic modeling can be a useful way to search for
                    general information. In my model for instance, each letter is composed of some
                    ratio of topics. These topics might signify schooling and education, or
                    advertisements, or political news.</p>

                <p>visualizes the rise and fall of genre similarities from the perspective of the
                    “fiction” genre. At the very top of the graph is the “fiction” genre, which
                    perfectly matches itself and provides an anchored point from which to measure
                    its likeness to other genres published each year along the x-axis. The other
                    lines indicate fiction’s similarity to other genres. The three lines in the
                    middle (“poetry,” “articles,” and “letters”) suggest that works of fiction
                    gradually adopted topics from these other genres, which is indicated in the
                    upward slope of each line, before falling. This graph starts to articulate the
                    dynamic nature of genres in serialized print culture by showing the fluctuations
                    of genres. Over time, texts could mimic other texts by borrowing their language
                    or differentiate themselves by using other content and words.</p>

                <p>From this zoomed out view, Figure 1 shows the rising similarities between
                    fiction, letters, and other genres from 1911—1913 and provides a different
                    perspective to understand and situate Baker and Osbourne’s correspondence.
                    Examining the topic ratios within these genres explains why they became more
                    similar and helps to align the model with Baker’s call for progressive
                    representation. The top ten topics in <q>fiction</q> in both years share many
                    similarities that relate to descriptive and narratological language (e.g.
                        <q>said back man eyes face looked saw</q>). In 1913, however, the race topic
                    (topic 30) emerges in the top ten list for “fiction” (<q>negro white people men
                        man negroes race</q>). This topic becomes a significant portion of
                        <q>fiction</q> where it previously only appeared in diluted concentrations.
                        <i>The Crisis</i>, of course, published fictional works about race from the
                    start. But, the growing prevalence of this topic in fiction suggests that works
                    during this time discussed race using more explicit terms at higher
                    frequencies.</p>

                <p>Topic models are far from perfect, but they provide a useful way to compare lots
                    of texts and genres. The <a href="http://modjourn.org/">Modernist Journals
                        Project</a> has provided hundreds of magazine issues. They have also encoded
                    them in a way that makes it possible to differentiate genres, like fiction from
                    poetry. Once the topic model has been made, we can go a step further and compare
                    how genres change over time. More specifically, we can ask, which genres mimic
                    other genres.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                        src="../images/2018-10-10_social-media-crisis/Crisis_GenreChange_articles-letters.png"

                </div>

                <p>This chart shows how genres in <i>The Crisis</i> became more or less similar to
                    each other. Significantly, these results suggest that from 1915 through 1917,
                    articles and pieces of fiction adopted many of the topics appearing in the
                    letters to the editors from the year before. This happens to be the same
                    timeframe that Lindsay lost his literary status in the magazine. Again, these
                    results are far from conclusive in any sense, but they do add weight to the
                    letters of Baker and Spingarn. For this three-year period, it seems that
                    whatever readers were writing about, authors and other writers would be writing
                    about them in the next year.</p>

                <p>the similarities of genres between <q>articles</q> (on the left) and
                        <q>letters</q> (on the right) become immediately clear. <q>Articles</q> and
                        <q>letters</q> share a high degree of similarity every year (they appear
                    high up on the y-axis), indicating a tight coherence between the two genres.
                    Articles and letters responded to each other and formed an identifiable pattern
                    of communication during The Crisis’s early years. By visualizing the close
                    relationship between letters and articles, these twin-like graphs reinforce the
                    apparent conversational dimension of serialized print culture as writers,
                    readers, and editors could easily share their thoughts (Churchill and McKible
                    2005, 1—2). Additionally, the similarity of <q>fiction</q> to both
                        <q>letters</q> and <q>articles</q> follows the same trajectory, further
                    suggesting that the changes in <q>fiction</q> correlate to language found in
                    these two genres.</p>

                <p>The three graphs illustrate the changing writing habits in periodical culture.
                    The convergence and divergence of genres here indicate a responsive relationship
                    between various actors in the magazine. Editors, writers, and readers borrowed
                    each other’s ways of discussing topics. As they picked up and adapted the
                    language of others, they were simultaneously aggregating and developing a
                    literary taste within The Crisis.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, I’m not sure whether the Harlem Renaissance is or is not a part of
                    Modernism in the conventional sense. Nevertheless, their formations were both
                    shaped in significant ways by magazines and their readers.</p>

                <div class="note" align="center">
                    <p>Addendum</p>
                </div>

                <p>Since I gave this talk, I was able to explore further which topic increases the
                    similarities between articles and letters. The race topic that appears
                    significantly in articles, letters, and fiction during the peak of their
                    similarities.</p>
                
                <!-- Need to explain this further: what is the "race topic" what does it mean in the context of The Crisis -->

                <div class="containter">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round"
                        src="../images/2018-10-10_social-media-crisis/Crisis_RaceTopicChange_all-genres.png"
                        alt="" />
                </div>

                <p>The chart above indicates that <q>letters</q> (bottom left) most frequently
                    discussed race using the key words of the topic when compared to other genres.
                    Although <q>articles</q> ranks second in this regard, the race topic diminishes
                    with each year of publication. <q>Letters,</q> on the other hand, regularly
                    contain language of this specific topic. It seems, then, that the readers’
                    letters—perhaps more so than articles, which included editorials and outside
                    contributions—played an important role in promoting this language.
                        <q>Letters</q> in The Crisis become more central to the magazine from topic
                    modeling’s perspective because this topic was a significant factor in increasing
                    the similarities between <q>fiction,</q> <q>articles,</q> and <q>letters.</q> This topic’s
                    persistent presence in readers’ letters, and its eventual emergence in fiction,
                    suggests the readers provided one major source for works that adopted a similar
                    language.</p>

                <p>Regardless of the editorializing of <i>The Crisis</i>, topic modeling elucidates the
                    responsivity of the magazine’s various actors. If the editors were highly
                    selective in order to produce coherence, then it seems that readers continued to
                    interact with those selections, establishing a positive feedback. The readers’
                    continued participation, therefore, reinforced the editorial decisions. <i>The
                    Crisis</i> wanted to amplify discussions about race on a national scale, and the
                    readers’ letters responded positively to that call. Rather than emphasizing one
                    group’s perspective over another, topic modeling helps to re-stage the
                    multivocality of magazines.</p>
