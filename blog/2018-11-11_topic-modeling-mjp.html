                    <p>This post briefly describes my reasoning for topic modeling <a
                            href="http://modjourn.org/">The Modernist Journals Project</a> and
                        explains some of the technical choices I made. For the R script, please look

                <p>Topic modeling, in a simplified sense, can be imagined as a process that reads
                    through a corpus twice. The first time the process finds topics in the corpus.
                    Topics are sets of words that frequently appear together. Then, the process
                    reads through the corpus again, assigning those topics to each document. The
                    goal of topic modeling is to return significant topics, or the subject matter of
                    documents.</p>

                <p>In <q><a

                            >Topic Modeling and Figurative Language</a>,</q> Lisa Marie Rhody
                    describes topic modeling as someone trying to predict what their neighbors might
                    pick up at the farmer's market based on past selections: <blockquote>Examining
                        the quantities and varieties of produce in each basket, you could begin to
                        predict not only the range of produce that might have been at the farmers’
                        market but also the relative quantities. Over the course of sampling your
                        neighbors’ baskets, you come to the conclusion that the selection of produce
                        at the farmer’s market consists of 20% green apples, 20% red apples, 15%
                        pears, 10% winter squash, 10% cantaloupe, 5% corn, 5% beans, 5% tomatoes and
                        5% assorted other kinds of produce that were different enough from one
                        another that it makes sense to just call them miscellaneous. As more
                        neighbors arrive, with baskets to examine, you can refine your predictions
                        about what the available selection of produce have been at the market.
                    </blockquote> Although there's always room for error, topic modeling similarly
                    guesses at what's in each document. After reading through a corpus, where it
                    recognizes the different topics, topic modeling then tries to guess at what
                    topics are in each document.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The image above from David Blei's article illustrates how topic models see a
                    text. The model goes through texts highlighting words that it believes belong
                    together as topics. The number of topics in a corpus is determined by the user.
                    A document can have multiple, significant topics.</p>

                <p>I've found that topic modeling has been an effective way for me to understand
                    magazine culture. I chose to topic model, as opposed to other methods (such as
                    stylometry or other methods based on term-document matrices), for two reasons.
                    The first is rather straight forward. In my trial-and-error exploratory phase, I
                    was getting better results. By better results, I simply mean that the results
                    matched my expectations. Genres and magazines would cluster together as I
                    anticipated.</p>

                <p>The second reason I use topic modeling is because it captures a level of language
                    that I am most interested in: subjects. Topic modeling tries to reconstruct what
                    writers wrote about. The "what" of writing differs than the style or "how" texts
                    are written, and this has certain implications for textual analysis.</p>

                <p>Subject material is easy to change. Writers can write about different topics more
                    easily than they can change how they write about those subjects. As I'll explain
                    a little further down, the difficulty of changing your style makes style
                    particularly good for discerning different authors through computational
                    methods. That same feature, however, makes it difficult to determine when a
                    writer changes her subject matter.</p>

                <p>Topic modeling's attention to content rather than style makes it particularly
                    useful for studying magazines and serialized print culture. Changing topics in
                    magazines is somewhat akin to trending topics and hashtags in social media. It's
                    one marker of cultural significance and signals what editors, writers, and
                    readers seemed to care about. While stylistics captures aspects of writing that
                    writers struggle to leave behind, topic models look at a level of textuality
                    that is very easy to change.</p>

                <p>Stylometry (the "how" of writing) was an early method for computational text
                    analysis, in particular for authorship attribution (<q>Inference in an
                        Authorship Problem,</q> Mosteller and Wallace). The success of stylometry is
                    in its ability to identify authors by their use of seemingly insignficant words,
                    especially prepositions. These words (often called stopwords) effectively
                    differentiate <i>who</i> wrote what. Simon Fuller and James Sullivan use text
                    analysis to explore authorship attribution in <q><a
                            href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000286/000286.html"
                            >Structure over Style: Collaborative Authorship and the Revival of
                            Literary Capitalism</a></q> (2017). Put another way, stylometry (and
                    other methods that rely on word counts) became very good at guessing
                    (identifying) different authors by the seemingly unimportant words they
                    used—even when an author wrote about different subjects.</p>

                <p>I think that the ability to (frequently) identify an author regardless of the
                    subject has significance. It suggests, to me, that stylometry captures a level
                    of language that is very difficult to change; that level of language persists
                    within an author across whatever subject she writes about. There are, of course,
                    some immediate exceptions to this conjecture. James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>
                    exhibits a particularly unstable and volatile style within itself. Also, T.S.
                    Eliot's <q>The Waste Land</q> is well-known for its many speakers, which <q><a
                            href="http://hedothepolice.org/">He Do The Police</a></q>, a digital
                    project, explores computationally. These are perhaps unique examples, though. In
                            <q><a
                            href="https://culturalanalytics.org/2018/11/measuring-modernist-novelty/"
                            >Measuring Modernist Novelty</a>,</q> Laura McGrath, Devin Higgins, and
                    Arend Hintze use computational text analysis to understand stylistic newness or
                    novelty within texts. Other examples, swing in the opposite direction. In <q>‘A
                        thing not beginning and not ending’: using digital tools to distant-read
                        Gertrude Stein's <i>The Making of Americans</i>,</q> Tanya Clement uses
                    distant reading to better understand the hyper-repetition in Stein's work
                        (<i>Literary and Linguistic Computing</i>, 23.3, 2008).</p>

                <p>My reason for topic modeling, then, is based on the common tendencies of magazine
                    writers and seriality—not some sense that topic models are better than
                    stylistics methods. While style is important, I've found topics to be more
                    reliable and stronger signals of cultural change. Computational text analysis,
                    however, involves a lot of moving pieces. There's the corpus, which can change
                    as new documents are added, and the computation. Within each of those, there are
                    even more options that can reshape the results—such as removing or keeping stopwords. While topic modeling works for
                    me for now, it's possible that new developments, or even reconfigurations of old
                    pieces, might be cause to revisit stylistics in the future.</p>
