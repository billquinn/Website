                <h2 align="center">Part 2.</h2>

                <p>This post continues from part 1, where I described doc2vec (how it works) and did
                    some initial tests. I found that doc2vec was able to re-produce some
                    expectations I had about the corpus from the <a
                        href="http://modjourn.org/index.html">Modernist Journals Project</a>.
                    Namely, different magazines and different genres used language slightly
                    differently. When I modeled and visualized the entire corpus, the graph showed
                    that magazines and genres clustered in expected ways. In this post, I use
                    doc2vec to explore some of my research questions: can doc2vec track the gradual
                    changes in cultural productions and do these changes reflect the tentative and
                    shifting interests in serial print culture?</p>

                <p>In the <a
                        href="http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1201882375609375&view=mjp_object"
                        >October 1914</a> issue of <i>Poetry, a Magazine of Verse</i>, Harriet
                    Monroe and Ezra Pound published opposing opinions on the relationship between
                    the artist and audience. Ezra Pound’s opening salvo begins, <q>I have protested
                        privately, and now I protest more openly, against the motto upon the cover
                        of Poetry</q> (29). Referring specifically to a quotation from Walt
                        Whitman—<q>To have great poets there must be great audiences too</q>—Pound
                    lays out his well-known tract against the <q>rabble of ‘respectable’ people,</q>
                    who might infect an individual’s genius. Harriet Monroe, on the other hand,
                    dismisses Pound’s world of <q>immediate audiences</q> reminiscent of the
                        <q>stay-at-home aristocratic age.</q> She argues <q>Art is not an isolated
                        phenomenon of genius, but the expression of a reciprocal relation between
                        the artist and his public</q> (31—32). The debate between Monroe and Pound
                    now marks a well-known moment in modernist studies: Pound would declare Poetry a
                        <q>meal-ticket</q> for mediocre artists and join like-minded editors at
                        <i>The Little Review</i> while Monroe would continue her successful
                    editorship without him.</p>
                
                <p>Leeroy Titus Weeks, a reader who wrote to the magazine and whose letter was
                    published, sides with Monroe and challenges Pound's belief in individuality and
                    pure originality. With playful sarcasm, Weeks stands in <q>bewilderment before
                        the vast knowledge of Mr. Ezra Pound,</q> who holds <q>final judgment</q>
                    for literary works at <q>his study table</q> (48). Pound, <q>full of fust and
                        ferment,</q> rails against the literary tradition as <q>the apostle of
                        discontent</q> and, in doing so, sets himself apart as tastemaker of <q>the
                        New Beauty.</q> The <q>new</q> beauty, Weeks argues, is never entirely new.
                    Weeks writes, <q>like every new growth of the coral islands, simply rising out
                        of and upon the old beauty,</q> the new beauty <q>never shakes itself loose
                        from the old.</q> Not only does newness emerge from the old, but great
                    literary works grow from the bad. <q>Without a vast field of mediocre
                        poetry,</q> Weeks writes, <q>we could have no literature. Mediocre poetry is
                        the compost heap on which grow Shakespeares</q> (49).</p>

                <p>Weeks's proposal that literature decomposes and recomposes in new forms provides
                    an interesting framework for applying computational methods. If doc2vec can
                    reliably cluster magazines and genres, can it also sort smaller documents and
                    reveal the recomposition of literary forms? Can it discern literary lineages in
                        <i>Poetry</i>? I re-ran the model to explore these questions but this time I
                    brokedown the <q>poetry</q> genre into 250-word chunks. Although there is some
                    overlap in chunking poetry—some chunks will have the beginning of one poem and
                    the end of another—the slight imprecision does not prevent the model from doing
                    its task. The goal of using doc2vec to retrieve literary lineages is to extract
                    similar language (which might map onto similar motifs or themes). These lineages
                    should extend beyond a single poem. This model assumes that motifs, themes, and
                    ideas recycle within print culture and, through repetition, enrich and grow or
                    waste away into obscurity. Here, textuality is a mixture. The composite nature
                    of literature is perhaps easier to acknowledge in serialized magazines, where
                    texts, authors, and genres intermingle and can stain each other.</p>

                </div>


                <p>Figure 1 shows a possible literary lineage. Each node in the graph represents a
                    section from a poem. The graph organizes these sections chronologically with
                    older poems appearing towards the left and more recent poems towards the right.
                    The positions of the nodes are relative, so Lindsay's poem appears near
                    Seiffert's but they were published five years apart (as the label indicates).
                    Each node is connected based on their similarity within the doc2vec model. Here,
                    Seiffert's drama(s) offer a baseline for reading the graph. <q>The Old Woman</q>
                    was reprinted in <i>Poetry's</i>
                    <q>Prize Award Number.</q> Doc2vec reads these works as sharing significant
                    similarity, which they do because they are nearly identical (there might be some
                    slight differences due to OCR and/or how the texts are broken down into chunks).
                    The other poems in the graph are more telling.</p>

                <p>Doc2vec connects Nicholas Vachel Lindsay and Amy Lowell, inviting a close reading
                    predicated on their supposed similarities. At first glance, though, each poem
                    seems very different. Lindsay’s poem portrays a wild party in a sleepless city.
                    Lowell’s hybrid genre of interspersed prose and poetry is set in a quiet living
                    room with a small boy playing with toy soldiers. The different settings of these
                    poems indicate that doc2vec is locating their similarities at a different level
                    of textuality. By turning to close reading, we can more fully examine what
                    connects these poems and restore their complexity. If their similarities are
                    modulations of the same semantic space—that is, their similar use of language
                    signifies towards the same poetic conceit—then close reading how these
                    similarities manifest will show how the same idea develops over time and how
                    language adjusts to cultural changes. Close reading takes up the weak
                    connections that tie these poems together, asking whether their similarities
                    extend to more complex levels of literariness. The following close readings will
                    focus on the passages that doc2vec identifies as similar.</p>

                <p>Lindsay’s <q>The Fireman’s Ball</q> (July 1914) describes a boisterous ballroom
                    that appears to catch fire as the musicians and dancers party into the night.
                    When the conductor ups the tempo of the band, the flames stretch higher up the
                    walls of the building. The poem depicts a ballroom engulfed with modern,
                    jazz-like revelry: <q>Listen to the music  Of the fireman’s ball—  Listen to the
                        music  Of the fireman’s ball.  “’Tis the night of doom,”  Say the ding-dong
                        doom-bells.  “Night of doom,”  Say the ding-dong doom-bells.  Faster,
                        faster,  The red flames come (pp. 125—126).</q> Music mixes with cityscape
                    noises, a siren, and the blaze. Lindsay’s repetition provides a rhythm and pace
                    that matches the scene, until a warning briefly interrupts it. As the poem
                    concludes, another voice speaks. Lindsay introduces this new speaker with a
                    Buddhist proverb from the first Khandaka of the Mahāvagga. The Mahāvagga
                    describes the awakening of Gautama Buddha’s ten disciples. In Lindsay’s poem,
                    this new voice warns of the destructiveness of vice, <q>Wine is fire…Hate is
                        fire…Life is a flame</q> (p. 130). The poem ends with a fire engine loudly
                    interrupting this teaching as it tries to rescue people from a burning and
                    collapsing building. Lindsay’s poem celebrates the wildness of joy and music but
                    eventually questions the delirious drive that leads to possible destruction. The
                    poem ends uncertainly poised between the violence of unregulated pleasure and
                    the lively joy captured in such abandon.</p>

                <p>Amy Lowell’s <q>Lead Soldiers</q> (September 1915) also pairs a consuming fire
                    with music but begins with a much quieter setting. In her poem, Tommy plays with
                    toy soldiers in the nursery. She begins with a description of the fire next to
                    him:  The nursery fire burns brightly, crackling in cheerful little explosions
                    and trails of sparks, up the back of the chimney. Miniature rockets peppering
                    the black bricks with golden stars, as though a gala flamed a night of
                    victorious wars (269). The scene here is much calmer than Lindsay’s erratic
                    jazz-party, but the similarities of the two poems start to emerge. Lowell
                    depicts the fire as a <q>gala,</q> providing the first comparative link back to
                        <q>The Fireman’s Ball.</q> After the description of the nursery, Lowell
                    transitions to poetry as <q>Tommy’s soldiers march to battle, / Trumpets flare
                        and snare-drums rattle.</q> The military instruments that appear in this
                    passage likely occupy the same semantic space as Lindsay’s diction in <q>The
                        Fireman’s Ball,</q> explaining why doc2vec sees a connection between the two
                    poems.</p>
                
                
                <div class="container w3-center">
                    <img class="w3-round zoom"
                        src="../images/2019-10-19_doc2vec-part2/Lowell_LeadSoldiers-Sept1915.jpg"
                        alt="Lowell's "Lead Soldiers" in Poetry" />
                    <p>Figure 3: Lowell's "Lead Soldiers" in <i>Poetry</i>.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Surprisingly, though, Lowell and Lindsay’s comparisons continue. Although <q>Lead
                        Soldiers</q> begins calmly in a nursery, Lowell imports scenes of real
                    violence in Tommy’s game. As Tommy leads his soldiers into a battle he cannot
                    comprehend, his toe catches the <q>leg of the wash-stand, and jars the
                        pitcher</q> (274). Tommy fails to catch the falling pitcher, and it
                        <q>crashes to the floor. But it is not water which oozes to the door. The
                        stain is glutinous and dark, a spark from the firelight heads to it red.</q>
                    In a surrealist mode, the water turns to blood and drowns the toy soldiers on
                    the floor. Like Lindsay’s poem, Lowell subverts the apparent playfulness with
                    unexpected violence. Here, Lowell undermines Tommy’s game of soldiers by
                    aligning it with military violence and self-destruction. These comparisons
                    likely go beyond doc2vec’s model, which is limited to 200-word chunks rather
                    than the entire poem. Tommy’s fall and the Buddhist caution appear outside the
                    passage that doc2vec links together. And yet, as the poems continue later
                    passages reinforce their shared themes and motifs.</p>

                <p>In yet another strange convergence, Lowell and Lindsay both evoke orientalist
                    figures to provide a dissonant counterpoint. In <q>Lead Soldiers,</q> a kitsch
                    figurine, the <q>nodding mandarin,</q>” overlooks the scene as the poem
                    progresses. The figure with <q>blue-green eyes</q> stares into <q>the air, and
                        he nods—nods,</q> with calmness. Apparently unfazed by the room filling with
                    blood and perhaps expecting it, the figurine continues nodding even when his
                        <q>rose is broken,</q> and falls into the <q>black blood</q> (274). Lowell
                    and Lindsay employ Orientalism to provide a knowing sobriety to their otherwise
                    violent scenes. While doc2vec provides the hooks that connect these two poems
                    together, close reading restores their literary complexities, which further
                    solidify their likenesses.</p>

                <p>Doc2vec collects passages with fire imagery interlaced with music descriptors.
                    These connections serve as platforms for further examination, highlighting
                    stronger complexities and similarities. Read together, these three poems
                    illustrate a progression of violence that drifts from local scenes, such as
                    Lindsay’s city or Lowell’s nursery. This thematic progression across these three
                    poems tracks with the progression of World War I. Doc2vec’s connections,
                    however, are significant because they offer a way to track Weeks’s and others’
                    conception of poetic composting. Each poem highlights the development of similar
                    themes and literary palettes over a seven-year span. While they do provide
                    bridges to the literary complexities of each poem, they are also links to
                    previous poems and accentuate the aggregation of literary taste.</p>

                <p>Literary complexities, such as themes, historicity, and theory, are the
                    predominant mode of literary analysis but are also its limit. Close reading does
                    not attend to certain kinds of knowledge, specifically the prevalence of
                    literary forms and their propagation elsewhere. Close reading tends to high
                    levels of abstraction that crystalize literature, fastening texts to specific
                    and often unchanging structures. Focusing on the high-level complexities of
                    literature draws out the limitless nuances of a text, but it also silos each
                    work. Texts fold into themselves and wait for theories to subsume them. The
                    focus on higher levels of textuality constrain literary analysis as much as they
                    enable it to explore texts deeply. Ultimately, the abstract levels of textuality
                    pull attention away from the routine practices of writers, which can elucidate
                    the fluidity of literary production.</p>

                <p>Weeks and other readers praised mediocrity and proposed a theory of literary
                    production, arguing that poetry was a communal process that matured through
                    literary composting. Literary values emerged within a dynamic and collaborative
                    system of cultural production. Doc2vec helps recover this composting by
                    rendering literary production as a web of weak connections composed of semantic
                    similarity. Once doc2vec aggregates many weak connections together, close
                    reading restores their complexities and elucidates the stronger, thematic
                    connections that bind poems together beneath their surfaces.</p>

                <p>Pulling together readers and seriality prompts literary criticism to attend to
                    the temporality of cultural capital. Harriet Monroe’s belief that the <q>great
                    audience</q> offered artists a <q>reciprocal relationship</q> indicates that many facets
                    go into cultural creation. Within any single poem, many voices coalesce. If
                    letters to the editor call attention to new timelines and new actors of literary
                    production, then the question of literary criticism cannot only ask what
                    dominant forms of literature are present. Literary criticism must content with
                    who or what keeps it there.How are dominant forms of literature made durable or
                    weakened? How does cultural capital change hands? To engage these questions,
                    criticism must contend with different scales of analysis and work to understand
                    how provisional, coincidental, even accidental literary similarities can
                    transform into strong structures of cultural capital and literary prestige.
                    Cultural studies should continue to interrogate the dominant forms within
                    literature but must also ask who or what allowed those forms there in the first
                    place.</p>
