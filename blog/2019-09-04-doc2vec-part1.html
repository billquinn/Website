                <p>In this first post, I want to share a tool I've been using to explore literary
                    influence: doc2vec. I've been using doc2vec to look at how poetry gradually evolves in <i>Poetry, a
                        Magazine of Verse</i> (and if doc2vec is capable of registering poetry's mutations). <i>Poetry</i> continues today, and was an important
                    literary hub of modernism in the early twentieth century.</p>

                <p>Doc2vec builds off its predecessor and namesake, word2vec, so starting there will
                    explain why doc2vec offers one way to model literary change (and, potentially, a
                    form of literary influence). Word2vec is a computational process designed to
                    capture the semantic relationships between words. For thorough explanations of
                    word2vec, I still refer to Benjamin Schmidt's <q><a
                            href="http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-25-Word-Embeddings.html"
                            >Word Embeddings for the digital humanities</a></q>, Lynn Cherny's <q><a
                            href="http://blogger.ghostweather.com/2014/11/visualizing-word-embeddings-in-pride.html"
                            >Visualizing Word Embeddings in Pride and Prejudice</a></q>, and <a
                        href="https://wwp-test.northeastern.edu/lab/wwvt/index.html">The Women
                        Writers Vector Toolkit</a>. Word2vec aims to reconstruct the semantic
                    relationships of words. To take one common example, the words <q>king,</q>
                    <q>queen,</q>
                    <q>man,</q> and <q>woman</q> share certain, culturally determined meanings that
                    convey gender and class. That is, a word2vec model can predict cultural meaning
                    with mathematical formulas, such as <q>king</q> - <q>man</q> = <q>queen.</q> By
                    capturing the relationship between words, word2vec improves on other methods
                    because it can recreate polysemy and understands analogies.</p>

                    <p>Image from Gidi Shperber's <q><a

                </div>

                <p>In capturing semantics, word2vec also captures cultural biases embedded within
                    any corpus, which Nissim, van Noord, and van der Goot discuss in <q><a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09866">Fair is Better than Sensational:
                            Man is to Doctor as Woman is to Doctor</a></q>. Although all algorithms
                    are infused with bias, word2vec differs from other computational approaches
                    which would only know <q>king</q> as a four-character sting of text. Schmidt
                    argues that word embedding models, like word2vec, <q>merit attention because
                        they allow a much richer exploration of the vocabularies or discursive
                        spaces implied by massive collections of texts than most other
                        [computational] reductions out there.</q> Applying word2vec to a corpus
                    enables a large-scale computational reading that is more attuned to cultural
                    meanings than most computational models.</p>

                <p>Word2vec, therefore, is useful for studying poetic language that relies on
                    nuanced combinations of words to create meaning. While word2vec transforms a
                    corpus into a single, long string of text, doc2vec remembers the borders of
                    documents, which can be set as issues of a magazine, individual poems, novels,
                    or other documents. Doc2vec takes the relationships of words that word2vec
                    discovers and re-packages them within their original textual boundaries. Doc2vec
                    and word2vec propose a specific theory of language: semantics emerge from
                    context. Each word maintains its many meanings; each meaning can be called forth
                    as a vector that points toward other words that share the same semantic space. A
                    single word’s multiple meanings can be highlighted or dismissed by querying in
                    different accompanying words. For these reasons, Quoc Le and Tomas Mikilov, the
                    developers of word2vec and doc2vec, report that doc2vec improves on previous
                    methods used to recover cultural semantics and maintaining the order of words
                    (2014).</p>

                <p>Doc2vec’s logic of semantics maps onto figurative language. Similar words in
                    concentrated textual spaces orients mathematical vectors as if turning their
                    signifiers towards the same direction. In this way, I believe doc2vec can
                    harmonize with figurative language, which, in a sense, also relocates the
                    meaning of a text outside the literalness of words’ definitions (denotations)
                    but within context clues (connotations). By leveraging the encoding practices of
                    the Modernist Journals Project (MJP), doc2vec can start the process of sorting
                    language-users into different communities.</p>

                <div class="container w3-center">
                    <img class="w3-round zoom"

                        alt="Scatter Plot of Magazines in MJP" />
                    <p>Figure 2: Scatter Plot of Magazines in MJP. Parsed by issue.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Figure 2 refracts the different magazines into sensible clusters. The <q>High
                        Modernist</q> magazines, such as <i>The Little Review</i>, <i>Poetry</i>,
                    and Dora Marsden’s magazines (<i>The (New) Freewoman</i> and <i>The Egoist</i>)
                    cohere on the right side of the graph. These magazines published canonical
                    authors, like James Joyce, Amy Lowell, T.S. Eliot, and H.D. While these
                    magazines on the right promoted avant-garde, experimental literature, the
                    magazines on the left were more explicitly political. <i>The Crisis</i> was (and
                    continues to be) the newsletter of the NAACP and was instrumental in fostering
                    the Harlem Renaissance along with other magazines. Under its first editor, W.E.B
                    Du Bois, the magazine published reports of racial prejudice and uplift alongside
                    their literary sections. <i>The Masses</i> was a socialist monthly and was
                    dubbed <q>the most dangerous magazine in America</q> (<a
                        href="http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=MassesCollection"
                        >MJP</a>).</p>

                <p>Figure 2, then, reconstructs the old facade of <q>High Modernism.</q> The
                    avant-garde magazines on the right, separated from the socially critical
                    magazines on the left, recover their apolitical posturing. Scholarship has now
                    thoroughly debunked the myth that canonized modernist were supposedly
                    disinterested in politics and ianti-commercial. <i>The Little Review</i>, for
                    instance, began as a socialist-anarchist magazine. Even after its notorious <a
                        href="http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1295552160506125&amp;view=mjp_object"
                        >Blank Issue</a>, where it committed to being a magazine of <q>Art,</q> the
                    editors continued to grapple with readers who demanded a return to its socialist
                    (political) roots.</p>

                <p>While doc2vec reproduces this fossilized portrayal of modernism, this brief
                    revival might actually signal that the computational process has worked well.
                    The illusion of an apolitical modernism held a strong grasp on modernist studies
                    until (more or less) the New Modernist Studies, when the field expanded beyond
                    the canon, and the rise of periodical studies, which brought new materials into
                    focus. Both movements complicated the history that many modernists ostensibly
                    promoted (while I’m most familiar with these two subfields, I am sure there are
                    others that also helped this shift). When doc2vec clusters these magazines into
                    modernist and non-modernist camps, the results are not suggesting now-overturned
                    myths of High Modernist were in fact accurate. Instead, I interpret doc2vecs
                    results as attending to a shallower surface of language; doc2vec takes the
                    modernist apoliticizing at face-value. As I hope to show in the next post, this
                    doesn’t produce a roadblock and can actually be leveraged for more insightful
                    readings.</p>

                <div class="container w3-center">
                    <img class="zoom"

                    <p>Figure 3: Scatter Plot of Genres in MJP. Parsed by genre.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Figure 3 visualizes clusters of genres. Again, doc2vec seems to be sorting
                    documents (the chunks of text encoded by the MJP) into discernable groupings.
                    The visualization above reflects the MJP’s encoding practices, which markup
                    genres within an issue as a bundle. So, all the poems in a single issue are
                    bound together and, when they are parsed for computation, they appear as if a
                    single string. Although the encoding is not as precise as a human reader, the
                    markup does not prevent documents from clustering intuitively. The five main
                    genres (poetry, ficiton, articles, letters to the editors, and advertisements)
                    settle into their own localized sites. Articles and letters share the same
                    space, which is a finding I am exploring further with my dissertation.</p>

                <p>What I find promising about doc2vec’s clustering is that it reproduces expected
                    intuitions about literary history, namely different magazines and genres use
                    language differently and, therefore, occupy different semantic spaces. Doc2vec
                    can leverage this encoding and move to another level of textuality, like peeling
                    off a layer of an onion, and begin to model the ways genres inflect each other
                    over time.</p>

                <div class="container w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/2019-09-04_doc2vec-part1/chord-diagram-sims.png"
                        alt="Chord Diagram of Genre Transfer/Influence" />
                    <p>Figure 4: Chord Diagram of Genre Influence/Transfer</p>
                </div>

                <p>Using the same data, but filtered and computed slightly differently, we can see
                    how doc2vec understands how semantics drift across genres over time. While the
                    cluster graphs of Figure 2 and 3 show a static picture of textual distance,
                    Figure 4 adds a temporal dimension by asking what genres are most like genres
                    from previous years. This graph starts to visualize how genres converge.</p>

                <p>Figure 4 shows the four main genres in <i>Poetry</i>: poetry, letters, articles,
                    and advertisements. The ribbons that span across the interior of the circle
                    indicate semantic similarity. The graph shows the trajectories of similarities
                    amongst each genre. The <q>poetry</q> ribbon, for example, curls towards the
                        <q>letters</q> arc, suggesting a semantic drift that moved from poems to the
                    language of readers. This one-directional movement likely highlights the readers
                    who discussed poetry through quoting, paraphrasing, or possibly adopting the
                    linguistic patterns of the poems they read. A reader, perhaps, intentionally or
                    unintentionally mimicked the writing styles of poems that she was reading and
                    wrote down a similar cluster of words in her own letter. Readers discussing
                    poems in a magazine for poetry is not significant. And yet, the graph elucidates
                    the flow of semantics within the magazine. The modes of cultural production and
                    the consolidation of literary taste manifests here as a ribbon unfurling from
                    one arc to another. Although language modulates differently in each genre and
                    within each magazine, doc2vec surfaces the hidden layer of semantics that run
                    beneath.</p>

                <p>I understand the doc2vec results above as both tentative and inviting. By
                    reproducing some basic, even if outdated, expectations of modernist magazines,
                    doc2vec seems to be capturing an aspect of magazine culture that discerns
                    variations in magazine and genre. Much more testing is needed (with different
                    datasets and different variations of the MJP corpus), but it works well for a
                    general overview.</p>

                <p>In my next post, I plan to continue using doc2vec to trace literary likeness
                    between lines of poetry.</p>
