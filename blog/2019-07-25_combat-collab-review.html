                <div class="note" align="center">
                    <p>This is a version of the talk I gave at the 2019 Association of Computers and
                        the Humanities.</p>
                    <p>Magazine Images from <a href="http://modjourn.org/">Modernist Journals
                            Project</a></p>
                </div>

                <p>My talk comes from a chapter of my dissertation, where I explore the social uses
                    and cultural work of language by examining literature’s influence on readers and vice-versa.
                    While literary criticism has nuanced theories of critical reading, the readers
                    themselves and, therefore, the consequences of language are often absent. To
                    explore questions about the infectious ideas within literature, I consider an
                    overlooked genre: letters to the editor published in magazines. Such letters
                    showcase readers’ efforts to evaluate and critique art, and thereby participate
                    in the formation of taste.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I consider a peculiar modernist magazine and employ topic modeling
                    to understand how the dynamics of genre play out over time and what sort of
                    cultural values might be signaled within. The goals of this project are not only
                    to recover readers’ commentaries on literary history but also to conceptualize
                    ways of critical reading that attend to seriality and magazine print
                    culture.</p>

                <p>As Hannah McGregor has argued, the open-ended state of periodicals
                        <q>challenge[s] familiar critical modes of reading</q> as <q>the complex
                        interplay of seriality and hypermediacy</q> surface (2014, “Remediation as
                    reading: digitising The Western Home Monthly,” 250). The challenge of seriality
                    resonates with computational modes of critical analysis as well. As Jo Guldi,
                    David Armitage, and Ted Underwood have noted, comptutational approaches offer
                    one route to move beyond the limits of conventional close reading.</p>

                <blockquote cite="Jo Guldi and David Armitage, The History Manifesto">The prison and
                    the coffeehouse became the two poles of macro-history, the pessimistic and the
                    optimistic account of modern institutions, into which micro-historians of the
                    Short Past poured their finer-grained details</blockquote>
                <blockquote cite="Ted Underwood,  “Why Literary Time is Measured in Minutes”">There
                    is a “surprising amount of consensus about certain aesthetic and rhetorical
                    choices. Our habit of condensing evidence into a resonant moment is a great
                    example. New Historical anecdotes are not the only way we achieve this. Our
                    titles are often organized by an implicit tableau: ‘The Madwoman in the Attic,’
                    ‘Unpacking My Library,’…They all evoke a brief episode from which you can unfold
                    a larger structure of feeling</blockquote>

                <p>Before I get to the computational aspect of this work, however, I first want to
                    focus on the materials that sparked this project. In particular, I look at a
                    magazine well-known in Modernist Studies called <i>The Little Review</i>. The
                    magazine began as bold literary and social review that regularly featured
                    avant-garde literature and supported radical political movements, namely
                    anarchism. Its masthead read, <q>Making No Compromise with the Public Taste.</q>
                    Although the magazine was tailored to a relatively small group of subscribers,
                    it nevertheless found itself obtaining federal attention on several occasions.
                    The first occurred when Margaret Anderson, the founder and editor, suggested
                    that <q >some one shoot the governor of Utah</q> and <q
                        >start the Revolution</q> (<q >Toward
                        Revolution,</q> 5). Her editorial was in response to the execution of Joe
                    Hillstrom, a member of Industrial Workers of the World, and prompted an FBI
                    investigation into <i>The Little Review’s</i> offices. Perhaps better known in literary
                    studies, however, is the magazine’s court battle over the publication of James
                    Joyce’s <q >Nausicaa</q> episode from Ulysses. The Society for the
                    Suppression of Vice charged <i>The Little Review</i> with obscenity, forcing
                    Anderson to discontinue the serialization of Joyce’s work. These and similar
                    events helped develop <i>The Little Review</i>’s significant and notorious
                    legacy in modernist studies.</p>
                <p>Of the many shocking moments in <i>The Little Review</i>’s fifteen-year run,
                    however, one stands out as perhaps the most peculiar: The September 1916
                        <q>Blank Issue.</q></p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round"
                        src="../images/2019-07-25_combat-collab/ach-2019_blank-issue-cover.jpg"
                        alt="Image of The Little Review's Blank Issue" />
                </div>

                <p>After two years of publishing, Anderson released this issue with these words
                    printed on the first page: <q>The Little Review hopes to become a magazine of
                        Art. The September issue is offered as a ‘Want Ad.’</q> Then, the following
                    page states, <q>...‘The other pages will be left blank.’</q> The next eleven
                    pages were intentionally left blank. The only content within the magazine was a
                    few featured letters and editorial pieces, including a series of cartoons
                    illustrating Anderson using her free time now that she is not editing.</p>
                <p>The Blank Issue, then, dramatically marks a literary community in the midst of
                    transformation. Anderson pledges to change the magazine’s politically-driven
                    agenda into a coterie for experimental and apolitical Art.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round"
                        src="../images/2019-07-25_combat-collab/ach-2019_puteklis-letter.png"
                        alt="Image of Puteklis's Letter" />
                </div>

                <p>The readers, however, rejected this transformation. The most common complaint
                    against the magazine after the Blank Issue was that the magazine had abandoned
                    its social and political interests. Louis Puteklis, a reader who appears a few
                    times, asks the editors, <q>What is your definition of art? You say: ‘Art for
                        Art’s sake,</q> but <q>that is only a phrase</q> (25). The editors provide
                    the motto, but not an explanation: <q>Why is there no encouraging editorial on
                        Art? Thirteen empty pages and not a word from the pen of the Art-sick
                        Editor?</q> Grasping at some understanding for the magazine’s sudden shift,
                    Puteklis’s letter leads him to his ultimate question: <q>for whom is The Little
                        Review published? For artists only, or for all people</q> (26). Puteklis’s
                    vision of literature is inseparable from the social dimensions of writing.
                    Whether <q>progressive or retrogressive,</q> he argues, <q>[t]here can be no art
                        without social vision, and without definite ideas.</q> His letter
                    articulates the same social concerns found in other letters.</p>
                <p>Setting up the two sides of this literary schism—the editors, who insisted on the
                    autonomy of art, and the readers, who demanded art that was politically
                    active—begins to tell a story about the dynamics of literary production in
                    serial publishing. But, it does not tell the whole story yet. It does not
                    explain what happened afterward. Did the editors or readers cave? Did literary
                    genres also change in the midst of these literary debates and commentary?</p>
                <p>I take up topic modeling to explore these questions and try to render literary
                    history of <i>The Little Review</i> as a dynamic and evolving environment. More
                    specifically, I topic modeled a large portion of the <a
                        href="http://modjourn.org/">Modernist Journals Project</a>, which has
                    digitized and encoded many literary magazines of the early twentieth century,
                    including <i>The Little Review</i>. Topic modeling, in a simplified sense, can
                    be imagined as a process that reads through a corpus twice. The first time it
                    determines what topics compose the corpus based on how frequently words appear
                    together. Then, it reads through it again, assigning those topics to each
                    document. The actual mechanics of topic modeling are much more complex, but
                    understanding these basics are what is necessary for my purposes.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                        src="../images/2019-07-25_combat-collab/ach-2019_topics.png"
                        alt="Sample of Topics from Model" />
                </div>

                <p>The topics match literary intuitions about the time period, including topics
                    about World War I and the Suffrage Movements in England and America. In order to
                    understand how literary attitudes changed over time, though, I then compare
                    genres to each other. I draw on others’ work which also investigates textual
                    similarity as a signal of influence and the consolidation of cultural taste.</p>
                <p>In order to determine whether genres were becoming more or less like each other,
                    I used cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between
                    two vectors. In this case, each vector is the ratio of topics in a single
                    document. Cosine similarity determines orientation rather than magnitude and is
                    more effective at representing data with many dimensions, such as topic
                    modeling. In <q>The Historical Significance of Textual Distances,</q> Ted
                    Underwood finds that topic modeling and cosine similarity can effectively serve
                        <q>as a proxy for human judgments about social difference</q> (2018, 1).
                    This method can highlight the cohesion and gravitational pull of genres within
                    the magazine over time.</p>
                <p>Rather than use the topic model to describe texts and their contents, this method
                    illuminates the fluctuations and hybridity of topics. Andrew Piper describes
                    this approach as <q>reading topologically,</q> where instead of defining
                    documents as predominately about a topic, this method instead retains a sense
                    that topics <q>reside across all documents in different states of likelihood</q>
                    (2018, <i>Enumerations</i>, 69). Topic modeling in this way, then, moves beyond
                    descriptions of documents and instead allows <q>us to see how ideas cohere, but
                        also fade away.</q></p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                        src="../images/2019-07-25_combat-collab/ach-2019_article-letter-sim.png"
                        alt="Graphs of Genre Similarity and Change Over Time" />
                </div>

                <p>What I found was that the similarity of topics in articles and letters weakens in
                    a way that parallels the literary debates found when reading individual texts.
                    In this graph, I combine the genres marked up in the Modernist Journals Project
                    and compare them to other genres within the same year. Here, the <q>letters</q>
                    and <q>articles</q> genres show how each genre relates to the others. For
                    instance, the <q>articles</q> graph on the left shows the similarities of
                    articles to other genres from 1914—1922. At the top of the graph, the
                        <q>letters</q> genre starts in close proximity, indicating that the two
                    genres shared a similar topic composition. Although the two genres’ similarity
                    declines steadily, it drops noticeably in 1916, when the Blank Issue was
                    published. These graphs reinforce the textual evidence that <i>The Little
                        Review</i> was splitting into different communities, separately organized
                    around different interests but hosted within the same magazine.</p>
                <p>I have included the <q>poetry</q> genre in these graphs to further explore what
                    an evolving literary community might look like. The graph on the right shows
                    similarities compared to the <q>letters</q> genre. Once again, 1916 is a
                    conspicuous year. The similarity between readers’ letters and poetry begins to
                    diverge at this time. Meanwhile the relationship between topics found in
                    articles and poetry stays the same.</p>
                <p>The relatively flat similarity between poetry and articles after 1916 suggests
                    that the two genres developed and changed together each year. These graphs, I
                    argue, illuminate the diverging interests of readers, editors, and poets. The
                    most common topics in the article and letters genre before and after 1916
                    further reflect the literary changes within <i>The Little Review</i> and hone in
                    on what specifically changed.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img class="w3-center w3-round zoom"
                        src="../images/2019-07-25_combat-collab/ach-2019_topics-comparison.png"
                        alt="Comparison of Top Topics in 1914 and 1918" />
                </div>

                <p>The addition of French and European topics becomes the most noticeable change
                    when comparing the top topics that appear in articles of 1914 and 1918. For
                    Modernist Studies, these European topics are likely familiar as they recall the
                    ex-patriots who America to practice Art in England, France, and other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The topic model elucidates the evolution of not only the political nature of the
                    magazine into an art coterie but also how a persistent and durable interest can
                    be rendered differently over time. The topic model suggests that turning away
                    from politically charged literature towards avant-garde, experimental poetry
                    included the promotion of French and continental writers. The movement towards
                    the European art scene would complete <i>The Little Review</i>’s transformation,
                    and Anderson would eventually move the magazine’s operations from New York to
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>But, what happened to the readers’ political concerns? The topic model only
                    indicates that they diverged but does not articulate whether their interests
                    simply faded away, persisted, or took on new forms of its own. Returning to the
                    magazine with a reading practice informed by the topic model heightens.</p>
                <p>The readers recognized the editorial trajectory of moving the magazine away from
                    politics, towards experimental art forms, and even further still to European
                    writers. In a parallel movement, the readers interests in politics also
                    transforms. They maintain their antagonistic stance against the editors interest
                    by calling for more American literature.</p>

                <p>One reader wistfully recalls a previous issue when the magazine <q>converted
                        [them] to a faith in New America</q> (31). Now, however, the reader knows
                        <q>surely the spirit of the old Little Review is dead</q> because it Ezra
                    Pound, who recently became the Foreign Literary Editor, has <q>Ezraized</q> the
                    magazine (32). Although the editors <q>seem to be proud of [their]
                        evolution,</q> the reader warns the new issues will <q>have no appeal to
                        Young America.</q> This reader typifies the changing concerns about the new
                    style of <i>The Little Review</i>. As the magazine seemingly moved further away
                    from social criticism, it also moved further away from America’s literary scene.
                    Readers conflated the changing state of the magazine—it’s effort to be less
                    socially aware—with an effort to become more European.</p>
                <p>The old tensions of politics and art transform and continue as tensions about
                    European and American art. The readers argue that European art will not relate
                    to American readers. The readers and editors also conflate the calls for
                    American literature with the spirit of the old Little Review, thereby aligning
                    it with its original political mission without addressing politics by name.</p>

                <p>In perhaps one final twist, the co-editor, Jane Heap, ends up publishing an
                    American Issue against the wishes of Anderson. This issue does not reverse the
                    growing number of Europeans writers in <i>The Little Review</i>, but it does
                    signal to its readers that their voices are—at least somewhat, partially,
                    perhaps only minimally—important. Heap’s note at the end of the issue echoes the
                    magazine’s masthead when she writes, <q>I am responsible for this issue. It was
                        made with no compromise to Margaret Anderson or Ezra Pound.</q> It allows
                    her to gesture to the readers’ interest in American literature without
                    necessarily committing to them.</p>
                <p>The ongoing arguments about art and society created a state of combative
                    collaboration in The Little Review. Disapproving readers continued to subscribe
                    to a magazine while challenging its new format. Anderson and Heap—and eventually
                    Ezra Pound—forged ahead with their new literary program, offering some
                    instruction on the new artistic regime’s values but little patience for dissent.
                    Editors and readers frequently collided in their letters. Rather than stunting
                    the growth of the magazine, the antagonistic presence of many readers in <i>The
                        Little Review</i> became a generative force in the evolution of the
                    magazine’s cultural field. Readers, editors, and authors competed with each
                    other in order to define the value of art and the magazine’s literary taste. As
                    such, the Blank Issue records a unique moment in print culture, one that
                    highlights the centrality of readers in literary production and the evolution of
                    a cultural field.</p>
                <p>The topic model provides a through-line for exploring the transformation of a
                    literary community. It marks how the community’s interests change and can also
                    prompt further investigation, which can reveal how durable ideas might appear in
                    different ways and be a continuation rather than an interruption of literary
                    priorities.</p>
